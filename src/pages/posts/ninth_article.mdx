## Why Rahasya? 

&nbsp;&nbsp; We all know the struggle — keeping API keys, passwords, and other sensitive info out of public repositories is a must, but it can be a pain to manage. 

&nbsp; That’s where Rahasya comes in. It bundles some of the best open-source tools into one package, making comprehensive scans a breeze.

<br></br>

## What’s Inside? 

&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/KaustubhRai/rahasya" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #f3865f; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Rahasya</a> combines the strengths of several top-tier tools like GitLeaks, Gitty Leaks, TruffleHog, Detect Secrets, Git Guardian, and Talisman. Whether you’re a developer or a security engineer, Rahasya is here to make your life easier and your code safer.

<br></br>
## How to Use It? 

&nbsp;&nbsp; Pull the Docker image and run it in your project’s root directory where it's git cloned.


```bash
// Docker
# download the image
$ docker pull raikaustubh/rahasya

# run the image at the project's location in a self deleting container once its done using
$ docker run -it --rm -v "$(PWD):/repo" raikaustubh/rahasya
```
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; You can customize the scans to fit your needs, whether you want to run all tools at once or pick and choose specific ones. The results are organized neatly, so reviewing them is a breeze.


<br></br>
## Shift Left Security for Devs
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rahasya isn't just for security pros; it’s great for developers too. You can deploy it as a GitHub Action, which means every time you push code or create a pull request, Rahasya will run the scans and alert you to any issues. 

&nbsp; It’s a fantastic way to integrate security into your development process right from the start.
