&nbsp; Hey security enthusiasts!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to VAPT, it's not just about the tools we use; it's also about knowing the ins and outs of the language the application is built upon.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every programming language has its unique quirks and features that can significantly impact your VAPT strategy. Whether it's a Python web app or a Java-based system, each language brings its own set of potential vulnerabilities and loopholes.
<br></br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've compiled a list of key points to keep in mind while performing VAPT on applications written in different languages. I've tried to make it a handy reference that you can quickly glance at during your assessments. If you spot something familiar in the code, these notes could instantly point you towards potential vulnerabilities to investigate.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you've got some insights or suggestions to add, don't hesitate! I've enabled commenting on the Notion page, so drop your thoughts and let's make this a collaborative effort.
