&nbsp; Heyyo, API sec fam! ðŸš€

&nbsp;&nbsp; Big news in the world of API security! The OWASP API Top 10, that holy grail of API security risks, just got a fresh update. Not officially up on their site yet, but they've released a <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #f3865f; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">new list of risks</a> that have earned their spot in the Top 10. 



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of folks have created new resources tailored to the 2023 version of API security best practices. And APISEC University did too. They've updated their course to align with these latest insights:
