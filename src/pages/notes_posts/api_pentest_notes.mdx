Yello API sec peeps! 🚀


You know how sometimes you dive into learning something new and end up with a shit ton of notes? Well, that's what happened to me with <a href="https://www.apisecuniversity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #f3865f; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">APISEC University's courses</a>. 


<a href="https://www.apisecuniversity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #f3865f; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">APISEC University</a>, for those who might not know, offers free and hands-on courses dedicated to API Security 💪

I went all in, devouring their courses and jotting down notes like there's no tomorrow. And guess what? I've decided to share these nuggets of wisdom with all of you! Why keep all the goodies to myself, right?

also helps me to keep up with writing on these blogs

I've compiled all my notes in Notion – might not win any awards for being super organized but there's something for everyone in there for you to get up to speed with API security. 

Notion really does not transfer from one platform to others all that seamlessly, or I am just too chill (or lazy, but let's stick with chill) to look it up for more than 5 mins. So simply sharing the link for the notes. 

These notes are are primarily from the <a href="https://www.apisecuniversity.com/courses/api-penetration-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #f3865f; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">API Penetration Testing Course</a> from APISEC University.

Check out my notes right here: [<a href="https://raikaustubh.notion.site/API-Penetration-Testing-Notes-29f195c69042461aa6d4f99a5014bf99" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #f3865f; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Link to API Penetration Testing Notes</a>.

Remember, it's all about learning, growing, and sometimes, about laughing at your own scribbles. So, go ahead, take a look, and let's keep the cycle of learning rolling!

Stay curious, stay sharp, and as always, hack the world! 🌐🔑
